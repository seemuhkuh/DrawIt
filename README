DrawIt is a plugin which allows one to draw lines left, right, up, down, and
along both slants. Optionally one may "cap" the lines with arrowheads.
One may change the horizontal, vertical, slant, and crossing characters to
whichever characters one wishes.

Its easy to start and stop DrawIt:

    <leader>di  start DrawIt
    <leader>ds  stop  DrawIt.

The alpha/beta version is available at

    http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#DRAWIT.

When DrawIt has been started you may use the number pad to leave a trail of
dashes, vertical bars, etc.  The lines will be expanded as needed to accommodate
your drawing.  DrawIt can also draw boxes and ellipses on a blank-filled area
(DrawIt can produce these) which can be useful for drawing boxes around comments.

Viart's <drawing.vim> has been merged with the original DrawIt (vimscript#11)
with permission.
Use visual-block selection to specify starting and ending positions and a
Bresenham line drawing algorithm will be used to connect the two.
DrC has written an ellipse-drawing Bresenham-style procedure:
again, use the visual block selection to specify a box to contain the ellipse
and <leader>e to trigger the ellipse drawing.

DrawIt incorporates an "erase" mode, toggled by the <space> key, that will leave
a trail of blanks behind and under the cursor as it is moved by the number pad.

Using the shift-arrow keys, DrawIt will move the cursor, expanding lines and
inserting spaces as needed, without changing underlying text.

DrawIt is now in the vimball format, which is understood by the new Vim 7.0
release. After decompressing the DrawIt.vba.gz file, edit it with Vim, and then
source it (:so %).  The components of DrawIt will then be placed where they belong,
based on your Vim's runtimepath.

DrawIt records many user options that affect DrawIt and all maps that starting
DrawIt creates. When DrawIt is terminated it restores the user's maps and options.
DrawIt's number pad maps will expand the file as necessary to accommodate the
drawing, automatically.
